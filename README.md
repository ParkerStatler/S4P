  A new github repository was made
  All of the required packages were then installed.

## Step 2
  Dataset was downloaded and put in the main branch of repository

## Step 3
  Using jupyter notebook through VS code allowed for some exploration of the data
  The data was also cleaned up a bit
  A scatterplot and histogram helped reveal data as well

## Step 4
  Created  an app.py file with required packages
  within file created histogram and then scatterplot with checkboxes
