# FOR REVIEWER: I'm not sure why my app will not open and gives an error. It worked when I just opened it through the terminal by using the 'streamlit run app.py' command and it looked all good with the dataframe and the interactive graphs, but when I put it through render it didn't work anymore. Can you please give some type of advisory or tip or hint for this issue as I work full time and it's very difficult to find times I can join the zoom tutor sessions that line up with the tutors. 
# Software Development Tools
## Step 1
  #### Render, VS Code, and Github all were already downloaded with accounts made for each. 
  #### A new github repository was made
  #### All of the required packages were then installed.

## Step 2
  #### Dataset was downloaded and put in the main branch of repository
  #### The repository includes a README.md file which provides insights of what the project was, an app.py file that has the code to tell the computer to run the app, a requirements.txt file with all he package versions, and two csv US vehicle files with the vehicle data, one is cleaned the other is not. Lastly there are two dirctory, one names .streamlit, and the other notebooks. The .streamlit dirctroy holds the config.toml file that tells render where to look in order to listeb to the streamlit app. The notebooks directory has a file names EDA.ipynb that has all of the exploritory data analysis as well as where the data was cleaned.

## Step 3
  #### Using jupyter notebook through VS code allowed for some exploration of the data
  #### The data was also cleaned up a bit
  #### A scatterplot and histogram helped reveal data as well

## Step 4
  #### Created  an app.py file with required packages
  #### within file created histogram and then scatterplot with checkboxes

## Step 5
  #### Added the requirements.txt file and .streamlit/config.toml to repository
  #### The Github repository was linked to render
  #### The required packages ti run the app were added.
  #### Created the app through render by the link
  #### https://s4p-r5ab.onrender.com
## Conclusion
  #### Through software development an app was able to be built with the dataframe and some graphs of the information on US vehicles. Streamlit was able to run the app through Render to make it available as a link. The app can be very useful for people looking to by a new car, car salesmen, car enthusiests, etc.
